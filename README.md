<h1 align="center"> ~ Multi-Image Super-Resolution Task applied to Sydney ~ </h1>

This repository is a copy of the RAMS repository (https://github.com/EscVM/RAMS), applied to super-resolution task on a satellite image of Macquarie university in Sydney (Australia).

This repository is only here to share the dataset of the satellite images from Macquarie University and its surrounding, in order to try to re-train the RAMS network. It is a messy repository not intended to be read or understood by a visitor.
